## Idea
Mimir is supposed to be a desktop AI Assistant similar to microsofts Recall Feature, but fully local, private, and open source. This way, your data stays where it belongs: with you, and you alone.

## Capabilities:

### Must-Haves:

* A chat window for interacting with the AI. Can be opened via on-screen GUI or Keyboard shortcut
* Answers displayed on-screen



### Nice-To-Haves:

* Voice input using OpenAIs Whisper tool
* Capability of taking a screenshot and analyzing it



### Very-Nice-To-Haves:

* Ability for the AI to use commands in answers, i.e.: "The solution to 9 + 10 is /math(9+10)" -> "The solution to 9 + 10 is 21"
* Ability for the AI to interface with your computer using text commands, i.e.: Opening apps, creating and editing files, executing commands
* Ability for the AI to interface with Home Assistant using text commands, i.e.: Turning on Lights, closing blinds
* Ability to add new text commands to the AI using extensions



### Do-Not-Want:

* Any kind of online capability, your data should stay on your device
