# Mimir
A fully local, fully private AI Assistant.

## Features
* Choose your own model, any .gguf works
* Use Speech to text to communicate with the AI more efficiently
* The AI remembers what you last said, you can hold conversations with it
* Ask the AI about things on your screen by providing it with a screenshot of the currently open program.
* Everything stays fully local


## How to install
* Download the latest version of the program from the release page
* Install the modules in requirements.txt
* Download any .gguf model and select it in the settings menu. (I recommend the dolphin-2.9.4-llama3.1-8b-Q4_K_M available at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/dphn/dolphin-2.9.4-llama3.1-8b-gguf))
* Start chatting with the AI


### Side notes
When using the Speech-To-Text for the first time, the program needs to download the Whisper STT Model. This requires an internet connection. As soon as it is downloaded, it will run locally, an internet connection is no longer required.
